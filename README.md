#A4

A simple theme for [https://ghost.org](Ghost), the blog platform.
Check out [tryghost/Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost) on Github.

###Information

This theme was created mainly for my own personal website, so a recent live preview is available at:

- https://iiro.jappinen.me

Created using [Chocolat](https://chocolatapp.com) and Safari's web preview after checking out the theme format from Casper, this theme uses HTML5 and CSS3, while keeping everything very minimal. It uses no external graphics and shows the website cover image (set from the Ghost preferences) as a sidebar image.

Media queries are used to optimize the theme for mobile devices.

Font used is Roboto Condensed(https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) and is served via the Google Fonts API.

Link color is used from the [Android Color palette](http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html).

###Usage

Simply copy the theme files to `Ghost/content/themes/`. Make sure the files exist in a subdirectory of `themes/`. A restart of Ghost is usually needed for the theme to appear in preferences.
